# gwpentesting
I thought I'd save readers of Georgia Weidman's excellent "Penetration Testing" book the runaround gathering the XP vulnerabilities :)
The only file I couldn't uplaod (due to the size limit) was xammpp.  You can download it from http://www.oldapps.com/xampp.php?old_xampp=45
Hope this makes Chapter 1 of Georgia's book easier for my fellow would-be Pentesters!
Enjoy the journey on the way to the destination!
